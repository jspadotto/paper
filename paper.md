# Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BBOA over West Africa. 

Particle size was measured using a PCSAP (Bloggs et al. 2004).

Jones et al. (xxx) conducted experiments.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale
